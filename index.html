                        <p>A recent study showed that people who believe in ghosts and other unexplained phenomena may live happier lives. A team of parapsychologists conducted an experiment which suggested that believers have a higher degree of stamina during times of stress as well as an increase of spiritual faith, potentially alleviating fears of one's own mortality. Those who claim to have seen a ghost might also feel more &ldquo;in tune&rdquo; with their natural surroundings after experiencing something supernatural. </p>
